# ## Time-Reversal Symmetry and Topological Insulators
# 
# ### Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS)
# 
# Time reversal is a transformation that reverses the arrow of time:  
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T}: t \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; -t
# $$
# 
# #### Consequences of TRS
# - In the presence of a magnetic field, a particle’s trajectory is bent.  
# - If we reverse the arrow of time, the particle will not retrace its motion.  
# - Therefore, **a magnetic field breaks TR symmetry**.   
# - they can exhibit other topological phenomena, such as the **nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification**.  
# 
# 
# ### Chern Insulators vs. TR-Invariant Insulators
# 
# - The existence of **chiral edge states** precludes time-reversal symmetry.  
# - Time-reversed edge states would describe particles propagating backwards along the edge.  
# 
# In **Chern insulators** (two-dimensional insulators with nonvanishing Chern number):  
# - The **absence of counterpropagating states** ensures reflectionless propagation along the edges.  
# - This follows from the **bulk–boundary correspondence**:  
# 
# $$
# \text{Net number of edge states at the boundary} = \text{Chern number of the bulk}.
# $$
# 
# 
# 
# ### TR-Invariant Two-Dimensional Insulators
# 
# - Time-reversal symmetry ensures that for every edge state mode, there is a **counterpropagating time-reversed partner**.  
# - Surprisingly, **no scattering occurs between these two modes**, so reflectionless propagation is still possible.  
# - These systems are classified as **two-dimensional topological insulators**.
# 
# 
# #### Classification of TR-Invariant 2D Insulators
# 
# All two-dimensional TR-invariant insulators fall into two classes:
# 
# 1. **Trivial class**  
#    - Even number of pairs of edge states at a single edge.  
# 
# 2. **Topological class**  
#    - Odd number of pairs of edge states at a single edge.  
#    - This is captured by the **$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant**.  
# 

# ### Time Reversal in Quantum Mechanics (Without Spin)
# 
# Consider a single particle with no internal degree of freedom, described by a wavefunction \$\psi(\mathbf{r})\$. Its dynamics follow from a time-independent Hamiltonian:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H} = \big(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - e \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\big)^2 + V(\mathbf{r}),
# $$
# 
# where \$\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\$ is the vector potential, \$V(\mathbf{r})\$ is the scalar potential, and \$e\$ is the particle’s charge.
# 
# The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:
# 
# $$
# i \, \partial_t \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) 
# = \Big[ \big(-i\nabla - e \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\big)^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \Big] \psi(\mathbf{r}, t).
# $$
# 
# 
# #### Complex Conjugation
# 
# If \$\psi(\mathbf{r},t)\$ is a solution, then its complex conjugate \$\psi^\*(\mathbf{r},t)\$ satisfies:
# 
# $$
# - i \, \partial_t \psi^*(\mathbf{r}, t) 
# = \Big[ \big(-i\nabla + e \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\big)^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \Big] \psi^*(\mathbf{r}, t).
# $$
# 
# This shows that **complex conjugation flips the sign of the vector potential \$\mathbf{A} \to -\mathbf{A}\$**, which corresponds physically to reversing the direction of the magnetic field.
# 
# 
# #### Complex Conjugation Operator
# 
# We introduce the operator \$\mathcal{K}\$, which acts as complex conjugation in the real-space basis:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{K} f(\mathbf{r}) = f^*(\mathbf{r}), 
# \qquad \mathcal{K}^2 = 1,
# $$
# 
# for any complex-valued function \$f(\mathbf{r})\$.
# 
# Using \$\mathcal{K}\$, the Schrödinger equation can be rewritten as:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{K} \, i \partial_t \psi = \hat{H}^* \, \psi^*.
# $$
# 
# This formalism sets the stage for understanding **time-reversal symmetry operators** and their consequences when we include **spin** (leading to Kramers’ theorem).
# 

# ### Time-Reversal Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics
# 
# In the special case where the Hamiltonian is **real in the position basis**:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H}^* = \hat{H},
# $$
# 
# time-reversal can be implemented simply by acting on the **wavefunction** with the complex conjugation operator \$\mathcal{K}\$.
# 
# This happens, for instance, when there is **no vector potential** (\$\mathbf{A} = 0\$). In that case, the Hamiltonian becomes purely real in position space.
# 
# 
# #### Time Evolution with Complex Conjugation
# 
# Let us consider time evolution for a time \$t\$, then apply the antiunitary operator \$\mathcal{K}\$, then evolve again for time \$t\$, and finally apply \$\mathcal{K}\$ once more:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{U} 
# = \mathcal{K} e^{-i \hat{H} t} \mathcal{K} e^{-i \hat{H} t}.
# $$
# 
# Since \$\mathcal{K}\$ conjugates the Hamiltonian,
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{K} e^{-i \hat{H} t} \mathcal{K} 
# = e^{+i \hat{H} t},
# $$
# 
# we obtain
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{U} 
# = e^{+i \hat{H} t} e^{-i \hat{H} t}.
# $$
# 
# #### Result
# 
# If the Hamiltonian is real (\$\hat{H}^\* = \hat{H}\$), then
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{U} = 1,
# $$
# 
# which means that **complex conjugation \$\mathcal{K}\$ acts as the time-reversal operator**.

# ## Time-Reversal Symmetry and Internal Degrees of Freedom
# 
# So far, we discussed time reversal in the case of a single particle with no internal degrees of freedom. However, in **solids** we typically deal with **lattice Hamiltonians**, where:
# 
# * The **external degree of freedom** (position) is discrete (lattice sites).
# * There are **internal degrees of freedom**, such as:
# 
#   * Sublattice index,
#   * Orbital type,
#   * Spin,
#   * or other internal labels.
# 
# To account for these, we must generalize the time-reversal operator.
# 
# 
# ### General Time-Reversal Operator
# 
# We define the time-reversal operator \$\mathcal{T}\$ as an **antiunitary** operator of the form
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} = U \, \mathcal{K},
# $$
# 
# where:
# 
# * \$\mathcal{K}\$ is **complex conjugation** in a fixed basis,
# * \$U\$ is a **unitary operator** acting only on the internal degrees of freedom.
# 
# A Hamiltonian \$\hat{H}\$ is said to be **time-reversal invariant** (TR-invariant) with respect to \$\mathcal{T}\$ if:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} \, \hat{H} \, \mathcal{T}^{-1} = \hat{H}.
# $$
# 
# This general definition encompasses both the **scalar case** (\$U = 1\$) and more complicated systems such as electrons with spin.
# 
# 
# ### Two Possible Types of Time-Reversal Symmetry
# 
# Because \$\mathcal{T}\$ is antiunitary, applying it twice gives:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T}^2 = (U \mathcal{K})(U \mathcal{K}) = U U^*.
# $$
# 
# Here \$U U^\*\$ acts as a unitary operator on the internal degrees of freedom. If this were nontrivial, it would represent an **additional unitary symmetry** of the Hamiltonian. Thus, the only consistent possibility is that
# 
# $$
# U U^* = e^{i \phi} \, I,
# $$
# 
# which is equivalent to saying that
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T}^2 = e^{i \phi}.
# $$
# 
# The remarkable result is that the phase factor can only take **two possible values**:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T}^2 = +1 
# \quad \text{or} \quad 
# \mathcal{T}^2 = -1.
# $$
# 
# 
# #### Proof Sketch for \$\mathcal{T}^2 = \pm 1\$
# 
# Multiplying the relation by \$U^\dagger\$ and iterating, one finds:
# 
# $$
# U^* = e^{i \phi} U^T,
# $$
# 
# where the superscript \$T\$ denotes transposition. Repeating this relation again leads to:
# 
# $$
# U^* = e^{2i\phi} U^*.
# $$
# 
# Thus \$e^{2i\phi} = 1 ;; \Rightarrow ;; e^{i\phi} = \pm 1\$.
# 
# Hence:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T}^2 = \pm 1.
# $$
# 
# 
# ### Examples
# 
# * **Case 1: \$\mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$**
# 
#   * Example: the scalar time-reversal operator \$\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{K}\$ (complex conjugation only).
#   * Appears for spinless particles.
# 
# * **Case 2: \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$**
# 
#   * Example: electrons with spin-\$\tfrac{1}{2}\$.
#   * Time reversal must flip the spin:
# 
#     $$
#     \mathcal{T} = -i \sigma_y \, \mathcal{K},
#     $$
# 
#     where \$\sigma\_y\$ is a Pauli matrix.
#   * One can check explicitly:
# 
#     $$
#     \mathcal{T} \, \sigma_j \, \mathcal{T}^{-1} = - \sigma_j, \quad (j = x, y, z).
#     $$
# 
# 
# ### Symmetry of \$U\$
# 
# The condition \$\mathcal{T}^2 = \pm 1\$ constrains the unitary matrix \$U\$:
# 
# * If \$\mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$:
# 
#   $$
#   U = U^T \quad \text{(symmetric)}.
#   $$
# 
# * If \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$:
# 
#   $$
#   U = - U^T \quad \text{(antisymmetric)}.
#   $$
# 
# This distinction will become crucial when we analyze the **band structure of TRI insulators**.
# 
# 
# ### Kramers’ Degeneracy
# 
# The most profound consequence of the \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ case is **Kramers’ theorem**.
# 
# Let \$|\psi\rangle\$ be any state. Its time-reversed partner is
# 
# $$
# |\psi_T\rangle = \mathcal{T} |\psi\rangle.
# $$
# 
# Because \$\mathcal{T}\$ is antiunitary, we have for any pair of states \$|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle\$:
# 
# $$
# \langle \mathcal{T} \phi | \mathcal{T} \psi \rangle = \langle \phi | \psi \rangle^*.
# $$
# 
# Now, take \$|\phi\rangle = \mathcal{T}|\psi\rangle\$. Then:
# 
# $$
# \langle \mathcal{T} \psi | \psi \rangle^* 
# = \langle \mathcal{T}^2 \psi | \mathcal{T} \psi \rangle.
# $$
# 
# * If \$\mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$: this gives no new constraint.
# * If \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$: we obtain
# 
# $$
# \langle \mathcal{T} \psi | \psi \rangle = 0.
# $$
# 
# Thus, \$|\psi\rangle\$ and \$\mathcal{T}|\psi\rangle\$ are **orthogonal states with the same energy**.
# 
# This is **Kramers’ degeneracy**:
# 
# * Every eigenstate in a system with \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ is at least **twofold degenerate**.
# * The pair \${ |\psi\rangle, \mathcal{T}|\psi\rangle }\$ is called a **Kramers pair**.
# 

# ## Time-Reversal Symmetry of a Bulk Hamiltonian
# 
# We now analyze the effect of time-reversal symmetry on the **bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian**.
# 
# 
# ### Plane Wave Basis and Bulk Hamiltonian
# 
# For a periodic system (periodic boundary conditions), we work in the plane-wave basis:
# 
# $$
# |k\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_x N_y}} \sum_m e^{i m k} |m\rangle,
# $$
# 
# where \$|m\rangle\$ labels a lattice site.
# 
# Under time reversal \$\mathcal{T} = U \mathcal{K}\$:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} |k\rangle = |-k\rangle \, \mathcal{T}.
# $$
# 
# The bulk Hamiltonian can be expressed in this basis as:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H}_{\text{bulk}} = \sum_k |k\rangle \langle k| \otimes H(k),
# $$
# 
# where \$H(k)\$ is the **bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian** acting on the internal degrees of freedom.
# 
# 
# ### Time-Reversal Symmetry Condition
# 
# Applying \$\mathcal{T}\$ to the bulk Hamiltonian gives:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} \, \hat{H}_{\text{bulk}} \, \mathcal{T}^{-1}
# = \sum_k |k\rangle \langle k| \otimes \big[ U H(-k)^* U^\dagger \big].
# $$
# 
# Therefore, **time-reversal invariance** requires:
# 
# $$
# U \, H(-k)^* \, U^\dagger = H(k).
# $$
# 
# This is the **fundamental constraint** that TR symmetry imposes on the bulk Hamiltonian.
# 
# 
# ### Symmetry of the Dispersion Relation
# 
# Let \$u\_k\$ be an eigenstate of \$H(k)\$ with energy \$E(k)\$:
# 
# $$
# H(k) \, |u(k)\rangle = E(k) \, |u(k)\rangle.
# $$
# 
# Applying the TR condition:
# 
# $$
# U H(-k)^* U^\dagger |u(k)\rangle = E(k) |u(k)\rangle.
# $$
# 
# After rearranging, we obtain:
# 
# $$
# H(-k) \, \big( U^T |u(k)\rangle^* \big) = E(k) \, \big( U^T |u(k)\rangle^* \big).
# $$
# 
# This shows:
# 
# * For every eigenstate at momentum \$k\$, there exists a **time-reversed partner** at momentum \$-k\$ with the **same energy**.
# * Thus, the dispersion relation satisfies:
# 
# $$
# E(k) = E(-k).
# $$
# 
# > This energy inversion symmetry is **necessary but not sufficient** for full TR symmetry — the internal structure of the eigenstates also matters.
# 
# 
# ### Time-Reversal Invariant Momenta (TRIM)
# 
# A particularly important case occurs at momenta where
# 
# $$
# k = -k \quad (\text{mod reciprocal lattice vector}),
# $$
# 
# i.e. where a momentum maps to itself under inversion. These are called **Time-Reversal Invariant Momenta (TRIM)**.
# 
# * In \$d\$ dimensions, there are \$2^d\$ TRIM points.
# * Example:
# 
#   * In 1D → 2 points (\$k = 0, \pi\$).
#   * In 2D → 4 points (center and three edges).
#   * In 3D → 8 points.
# 
# At a TRIM point, the TRS condition reduces to:
# 
# $$
# U H(k_{\text{TRIM}})^* U^\dagger = H(k_{\text{TRIM}}).
# $$
# 
# 
# ### Kramers’ Degeneracy at TRIM
# 
# If \$\mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ (e.g. electrons with spin-\$\tfrac{1}{2}\$), then **Kramers’ theorem applies**.
# 
# * At each TRIM point, every eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian is at least **twofold degenerate**.
# * Each state \$|u\rangle\$ has a **Kramers partner** \$\mathcal{T}|u\rangle\$ at the *same momentum* and *same energy*, and they are orthogonal.
# 
# This is the microscopic origin of **protected band degeneracies** in TRI systems and a key step toward the \$\mathbb{Z}\_2\$ topological classification.
# 

# 
# 
# ## Doubling the Hilbert Space for Time-Reversal Symmetry
# 
# We want to **construct a Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry** starting from a given lattice Hamiltonian \$H\$.
# 
# 
# ### Step 1. Doubling the System
# 
# Take two identical copies of the system:
# 
# * Copy 0 carries the original Hamiltonian \$H\$.
# * Copy 1 carries its complex-conjugated partner \$H^\* = K H K\$.
# 
# We then couple them. The full Hamiltonian is:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H}_{\text{TRI}} = |0\rangle\langle 0| \otimes H \;+\; |1\rangle\langle 1| \otimes H^*
# \;+\;\Big( |0\rangle\langle 1| \otimes I_{\text{ext}} \otimes C \;+\; \text{h.c.} \Big),
# $$
# 
# where \$C\$ is a coupling operator acting only on the **internal degrees of freedom** (spin, orbital, etc.), and is independent of lattice position.
# 
# ### Step 2. Matrix Representation
# 
# In block-matrix notation, the Hamiltonian looks like:
# 
# $$
# H_{\text{TRI}} =
# \begin{pmatrix}
# H & C \\
# C^\dagger & H^*
# \end{pmatrix}.
# $$
# 
# Here, the **copy index** is made explicit.
# 
# 
# ### Step 3. Pauli Operators in Copy Space
# 
# We introduce Pauli matrices \$\sigma\_x, \sigma\_y, \sigma\_z\$ acting on the **copy degree of freedom**:
# 
# $$
# \sigma_{x,y,z} = \sigma_{x,y,z} \otimes I_{\text{ext}} \otimes I_{\text{int}}.
# $$
# 
# Then we can rewrite:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H}_{\text{TRI}}
# = \frac{1+\sigma_z}{2} \otimes H
# + \frac{1-\sigma_z}{2} \otimes H^*
# + \frac{\sigma_x+i\sigma_y}{2} \otimes C
# + \frac{\sigma_x-i\sigma_y}{2} \otimes C^\dagger.
# $$
# 
# This makes the time-reversal structure manifest.
# 
# 
# ### Step 4. Choice of Coupling Operator Determines TR Symmetry
# 
# The crucial point: **whether the time-reversal operator squares to \$+1\$ or \$-1\$ depends on the symmetry of \$C\$.**
# 
# 
# #### Case A. \$ \mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ (Kramers TR symmetry)
# 
# We choose the TR operator as:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} = i \sigma_y \, K,
# $$
# 
# where \$K\$ is complex conjugation.
# 
# * Note: \$i\sigma\_y\$ is real, so that the operator acts antiunitarily but keeps things tidy.
# 
# Applying this to the Hamiltonian gives:
# 
# $$
# (i\sigma_y K) H_{\text{TRI}} (i\sigma_y K)^{-1}
# = \begin{pmatrix}
# H & -C^T \\
# -C^* & H^*
# \end{pmatrix}.
# $$
# 
# This equals \$H\_{\text{TRI}}\$ if and only if
# 
# $$
# C = -C^T,
# $$
# 
# i.e. \$C\$ must be **antisymmetric**.
# 
# So:
# 
# * Antisymmetric coupling \$;\Rightarrow; \mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ (spin-\$\tfrac{1}{2}\$ type TR symmetry).
# * This case exhibits **Kramers degeneracy**.
# 
# 
# #### Case B. \$ \mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$ (bosonic TR symmetry)
# 
# Instead, choose:
# 
# $$
# \mathcal{T} = \sigma_x K.
# $$
# 
# Then
# 
# $$
# (\sigma_x K) H_{\text{TRI}} (\sigma_x K)^{-1}
# = \begin{pmatrix}
# H & C^T \\
# C^* & H^*
# \end{pmatrix}.
# $$
# 
# This equals \$H\_{\text{TRI}}\$ if and only if
# 
# $$
# C = C^T,
# $$
# 
# i.e. \$C\$ must be **symmetric**.
# 
# So:
# 
# * Symmetric coupling \$;\Rightarrow; \mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$.
# 
# 
# ### Step 5. Special Case: Only Want \$ \mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$
# 
# If we only want TRS with \$\mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$, we don’t even need to double the Hilbert space.
# 
# * Simply define
# 
# $$
# H_{\text{TRI}} = \frac{1}{2}\big( H + H^* \big).
# $$
# 
# This is equivalent to taking the **real part** of the Hamiltonian.
# 
# 
# ### Summary
# 
# * **Doubling trick**: build a TR-invariant Hamiltonian by combining \$H\$ and \$H^\*\$.
# * **Coupling operator \$C\$** decides the symmetry class:
# 
#   * Antisymmetric \$C ; \Rightarrow; \mathcal{T}^2 = -1\$ (fermionic TR, Kramers degeneracy).
#   * Symmetric \$C ; \Rightarrow; \mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$ (bosonic TR).
# * For \$\mathcal{T}^2 = +1\$, doubling isn’t necessary: just take the real part.
