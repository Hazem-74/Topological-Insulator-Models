# # __Tight-Binding Model in 1D__
# 

# ### The Tight-Binding Model
# 
# The tight-binding model is a simplified framework for describing electron motion in solids by discretizing space. In this approach, the electron is restricted to occupy only atomic positions within a solid and can "hop" to neighboring sites due to quantum tunneling.
# 
# Consider a one-dimensional lattice of $N$ atoms spaced at intervals of $a$. The Hilbert space is $N$-dimensional, spanned by orthonormal position states $|n\rangle$ with $n = 1, 2, \dots, N$.
# 
# If the electron remains localized on a single atom, the system is governed by a Hamiltonian of the form:
# 
# $$
# H_0 = E_0 \sum_n |n\rangle \langle n|
# $$
# 
# Each state $|n\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_0$ with energy $E_0$, and no dynamics occur. To introduce motion, we incorporate quantum tunneling by allowing transitions between neighboring sites.
# 
# From time-dependent quantum mechanics, a general state evolves as:
# 
# $$
# |\psi(t + \Delta t)\rangle = |\psi(t)\rangle - \frac{i\Delta t}{\hbar} H|\psi(t)\rangle + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)
# $$

# ### Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC):  
# 
# To model hopping between sites $n$ and $m$, the Hamiltonian must include terms like $|m\rangle\langle n|$. We also enforce **locality**, meaning that hopping is allowed only between nearest neighbors.
# 
# The full tight-binding Hamiltonian (with Periodic Boundary Conditions) becomes:
# $$
# \boxed{H = E_0 \sum_{n=1}^N |n\rangle\langle n| - t \sum_{n=1}^N \left( |n\rangle\langle n+1| + |n+1\rangle\langle n| \right)}
# \tag{2.1}
# $$
# 
# Here, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, a real and positive parameter.
# 
# The Hamiltonian (2.1) assumes periodic boundary conditions, meaning that the lattice "wraps around" such that site $ N+1 $ is identified with site $ 1 $. This implies $ |N+1\rangle \equiv |1\rangle $, and thus hopping occurs between site $ N $ and site $ 1 $. PBC preserves translational symmetry, enabling the use of plane-wave eigenstates $ \psi_n \propto e^{ikna} $ and leading to the discrete quantization of wavenumber $ k $.
# 
# 
# In matrix form, for a lattice of $N = 5$, the Hamiltonian looks like:
# 
# $$
# H = 
# \begin{pmatrix}
# E_0 & -t & 0 & 0 & -t \\
# -t & E_0 & -t & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & -t & E_0 & -t & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & -t & E_0 & -t \\
# -t & 0 & 0 & -t & E_0 \\
# \end{pmatrix}
# $$

# ### Solving the Tight-Binding Model
# 
# To solve the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.1), we consider a general quantum state:
# 
# $$
# |\psi\rangle = \sum_m \psi_m |m\rangle
# $$
# 
# Substituting into the time-independent Schrödinger equation $H|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle$, we obtain:
# 
# $$
# E_0 \sum_m \psi_m |m\rangle - t \sum_m \left( \psi_{m+1} |m\rangle + \psi_m |m+1\rangle \right) = E \sum_m \psi_m |m\rangle
# $$
# 
# Projecting onto $\langle n|$, we find a set of coupled difference equations for the coefficients $\psi_n$:
# 
# $$
# E_0 \psi_n - t(\psi_{n+1} + \psi_{n-1}) = E \psi_n
# \tag{2.2}
# $$
# 
# This linear recurrence relation is solved by the ansatz:
# 
# $$
# \psi_n = e^{ikna}
# \tag{2.3}
# $$
# 
# or more precisely $\psi_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} e^{ikna}$ for normalized wavefunctions. Here, $k$ is the **wavenumber**, and $p = \hbar k$ acts analogously to momentum in the discrete model.
# 

# #### Brillouin Zone and Quantization
# 
# The solutions are periodic in $k$, meaning the wavefunction is invariant under $k \rightarrow k + 2\pi/a$. Therefore, allowed values of $k$ lie in the **first Brillouin zone**:
# 
# $$
# k \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{a}, +\frac{\pi}{a} \right]
# \tag{2.4}
# $$
# 
# Additionally, the periodic boundary condition $\psi_{N+1} = \psi_1$ imposes quantization of $k$ as:
# 
# $$
# k = \frac{2\pi}{aN} m, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad m = 0, 1, ..., N-1
# $$
# 
# Hence, there are exactly $N$ distinct quantum states of the form (2.3).
# 
# Inserting this into Eq. (2.2), we obtain the energy dispersion relation:
# 
# $$
# E(k) = E_0 - 2t \cos(ka)
# \tag{2.5}
# $$
# 
# This is the energy spectrum of the tight-binding model. It forms a **single energy band** with bandwidth $4t$, spanning the interval:
# 
# $$
# E(k) \in [E_0 - 2t, E_0 + 2t]
# $$

# ### Open Boundary Conditions (OBC)
# 
# To model hopping between adjacent sites $ n $ and $ n+1 $, we include terms like $ |n\rangle\langle n+1| + |n+1\rangle\langle n| $ in the Hamiltonian. We enforce **locality**, meaning hopping is allowed only between nearest neighbors. However, **under open boundary conditions (OBC)**, there is **no connection between the first and last sites** — that is, no $ |1\rangle\langle N| $ or $ |N\rangle\langle 1| $.
# 
# The tight-binding Hamiltonian with **Open Boundary Conditions** is:
# 
# $$
# \boxed{H = E_0 \sum_{n=1}^N |n\rangle\langle n| - t \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \left( |n\rangle\langle n+1| + |n+1\rangle\langle n| \right)}
# \tag{2.1'}
# $$
# 
# Here, $ t $ is the hopping amplitude, a real and positive parameter.
# 
# Unlike periodic boundary conditions, OBC **breaks translational symmetry**. As a result, the energy eigenstates are no longer plane waves. Instead, they form **standing waves** due to the physical boundaries at both ends.
# 
# #### Boundary Conditions and Eigenstates
# 
# We impose $ \psi_0 = 0 $ and $ \psi_{N+1} = 0 $, analogous to a particle in a box. Solving the discrete Schrödinger equation:
# $$
# E \psi_n = E_0 \psi_n - t (\psi_{n+1} + \psi_{n-1})
# $$
# with the ansatz $ \psi_n = \sin(k n a) $, the condition $ \psi_{N+1} = 0 $ leads to:
# $$
# \sin(k (N+1) a) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k_m = \frac{m\pi}{(N+1)a}, \quad m = 1, 2, \dots, N
# $$
# 
# The normalized eigenstates are:
# $$
# \psi_n^{(m)} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N+1}} \sin(k_m n a)
# $$
# 
# These are **standing wave** solutions, forming an orthonormal basis for the $ N $-dimensional Hilbert space.
# 
# #### Energy Spectrum
# 
# The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:
# $$
# E(k_m) = E_0 - 2t \cos(k_m a) = E_0 - 2t \cos\left( \frac{m\pi}{N+1} \right)
# $$
# 
# This is the exact spectrum for a finite one-dimensional tight-binding chain with open ends.
# 
# #### Matrix Representation
# 
# In **matrix form**, for $ N = 5 $, the Hamiltonian becomes:
# 
# $$
# H = 
# \begin{pmatrix}
# E_0 & -t & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# -t & E_0 & -t & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & -t & E_0 & -t & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & -t & E_0 & -t \\
# 0 & 0 & 0 & -t & E_0 \\
# \end{pmatrix}
# $$
# 
# This tridiagonal structure reflects nearest-neighbor hopping with no wrap-around, characteristic of open boundary conditions.

# ### Key Physical Insights To remember
# 
# * **Delocalization of States:**
#   The eigenstates $|n\rangle$ of $H_0$ are spatially localized. However, even an infinitesimal hopping parameter $t$ fully delocalizes the eigenstates across the entire lattice.
# 
# * **Lifting of Degeneracy:**
#   The degeneracy of $H_0$ is broken by the hopping term. Each eigenstate is now labeled by a distinct wavenumber $k$, and the energy spectrum forms a continuous band.
# 
# * **Low-Energy Behavior:**
#   For small $k \ll \pi/a$, we can expand Eq. (2.5) to second order:
# 
#   $$
#   E(k) \approx E_0 - 2t + ta^2 k^2
#   $$
# 
#   This resembles the energy of a free particle in the continuum:
# 
#   $$
#   E_{\text{free}} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}
#   \tag{2.6}
#   $$
# 
#   Comparing the two, we define an **effective mass**:
# 
#   $$
#   m^* = \frac{\hbar^2}{2ta^2}
#   $$
# 
#   This effective mass arises from the lattice structure, not from the intrinsic electron mass.
# 
# * **Position-Momentum Duality:**
#   Finite spatial domains enforce momentum quantization, as in a particle on a ring. Conversely, a discrete spatial structure implies that momentum becomes periodic. This interplay reflects the Fourier duality between spatial compactness and momentum discreteness.
