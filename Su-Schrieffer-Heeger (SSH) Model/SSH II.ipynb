# # __Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Model II__
# 
# ## _(1D Topological Insulator)_
# 

# The deep connection between **bulk topology** and the existence of **edge states** is examined—a defining feature of topological phases known as the **bulk–boundary correspondence**. In the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model, this correspondence is protected by a fundamental symmetry: **chiral symmetry**.
# 
# ## Chiral Symmetry
# 
# A Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ is said to possess a unitary symmetry $\hat{U}$ if  
# $$
# \hat{U} \hat{H} \hat{U}^\dagger = \hat{H}.
# $$  
# When such a symmetry is present, simultaneous diagonalization of $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{U}$ is possible, and the Hilbert space is partitioned into sectors labeled by the eigenvalues of $\hat{U}$. Dynamics governed by $\hat{H}$ are then confined within each sector.
# 
# In contrast, **chiral symmetry** is defined by the existence of a unitary operator $\hat{\Gamma}$ such that  
# $$ \boxed{
# \hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}^\dagger = -\hat{H}.}
# $$  
# This condition results in a spectrum that is symmetric about zero energy: for every eigenstate $|n\rangle$ with energy $E_n$, a corresponding eigenstate $\hat{\Gamma}|n\rangle$ with energy $-E_n$ is guaranteed.
# 
# The chiral symmetry operator $\hat{\Gamma}$ is required to satisfy three key conditions:
# 
# 1. **Unitary and Hermitian**:  
#    $$
#    \hat{\Gamma}^\dagger = \hat{\Gamma}, \quad \hat{\Gamma}^2 = 1.
#    $$  
#    This ensures that $\hat{\Gamma}$ has eigenvalues $\pm 1$ and prevents the emergence of additional unitary symmetries from $\hat{\Gamma}^2$.
# 
# 2. **Locality**:  
#    The operator $\hat{\Gamma}$ is restricted to act within individual unit cells. For the SSH model, matrix elements between sites of different unit cells vanish:  
#    $$
#    \langle n, \alpha | \hat{\Gamma} | n', \alpha' \rangle = 0 \quad \text{for } n \ne n',
#    $$  
#    where $\alpha, \alpha' \in \{A, B\}$. The operator can be expressed as a tensor product over unit cells:  
#    $$
#    \hat{\Gamma} = \bigotimes_{n=1}^N \gamma,
#    $$  
#    with $\gamma$ acting on the internal sublattice space.
# 
# 3. **Robustness**:  
#    The symmetry must hold uniformly across all parameter realizations (e.g., including disorder). For a family of Hamiltonians $\{\hat{H}(\theta)\}$, it is required that  
#    $$
#    \hat{\Gamma} \hat{H}(\theta) \hat{\Gamma} = -\hat{H}(\theta) \quad \forall\, \theta,
#    $$  
#    with the same $\hat{\Gamma}$, independent of $\theta$.
# 
# ### Sublattice Structure
# 
# The term **sublattice symmetry** is often used interchangeably with chiral symmetry. Projectors onto sublattices $A$ and $B$ are defined as  
# $$
# \hat{P}_A = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \hat{\Gamma}), \quad \hat{P}_B = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \hat{\Gamma}).
# $$  
# These satisfy $\hat{P}_A + \hat{P}_B = 1$ and $\hat{P}_A \hat{P}_B = 0$. Under chiral symmetry, the Hamiltonian is constrained such that  
# $$
# \hat{P}_A \hat{H} \hat{P}_A = \hat{P}_B \hat{H} \hat{P}_B = 0,
# $$  
# and thus only couples different sublattices:  
# $$
# \hat{H} = \hat{P}_A \hat{H} \hat{P}_B + \hat{P}_B \hat{H} \hat{P}_A.
# $$  
# This bipartite structure is inherent to the SSH model.
# 
# ### Spectrum Symmetry
# 
# The energy spectrum of a chiral symmetric Hamiltonian is symmetric about zero. Given an eigenstate $|n\rangle$ with energy $E_n$, the state $\hat{\Gamma}|n\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\hat{H}$ with energy $-E_n$, as shown by  
# $$
# \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma} |n\rangle = -\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} |n\rangle = -E_n \hat{\Gamma} |n\rangle.
# $$
# 
# - For $E_n \ne 0$: the states $|n\rangle$ and $\hat{\Gamma}|n\rangle$ are orthogonal and form a degenerate pair at $\pm E_n$. It follows that  
#   $$
#   \langle n | \hat{\Gamma} | n \rangle = \langle n | \hat{P}_A - \hat{P}_B | n \rangle = 0,
#   $$  
#   indicating that nonzero-energy eigenstates have equal weight on both sublattices.
# 
# - For $E_n = 0$: zero-energy eigenstates can be chosen as eigenstates of $\hat{\Gamma}$, and thus are supported entirely on a single sublattice. These states are invariant under the chiral symmetry operation up to a sign, and are referred to as self-conjugate.
# 
# ### Chiral Symmetry in the SSH Model
# 
# The SSH Hamiltonian is inherently bipartite, containing only inter-sublattice hoppings. The sublattice projectors are given by  
# $$
# \hat{P}_A = \sum_{n=1}^N |n_A\rangle\langle n_A|, \quad \hat{P}_B = \sum_{n=1}^N |n_B\rangle\langle n_B|,
# $$  
# and the chiral symmetry operator is defined as  
# $$
# \hat{\Gamma} = \hat{P}_A - \hat{P}_B.
# $$  
# The anticommutation relation  
# $$
# \hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma} = -\hat{H}
# $$  
# is satisfied, as each hopping term $|n_A\rangle\langle n'_B|$ acquires exactly one minus sign under conjugation by $\hat{\Gamma}$. This property is preserved even in the presence of spatially varying hopping amplitudes, ensuring the **robustness** of chiral symmetry.

# ## Bulk Winding Number
# 
# In momentum space, the bulk Hamiltonian is  
# $$
# \hat{H}(k) = \vec{d}(k) \cdot \vec{\sigma}, \quad \vec{d}(k) = (t1+ t2  \cos k, t2  \sin k, 0).
# $$
# * Chiral symmetry forces $d_z(k) = 0$, so $\vec{d}(k)$ lies in the $xy$-plane.
# 
# * As $k$ traverses the Brillouin zone, the tip of $\vec{d}(k)$ traces a closed loop.
# 
# * For an insulator, this loop must avoid the origin (otherwise the gap closes). 
# 
# * The number of times it winds around the origin is the **winding number** $\nu$, an integer topological invariant.
# 
# Thus, chiral symmetry enables a well-defined winding number in the bulk, which in turn determines the number of edge states at the boundary—establishing the **bulk–boundary correspondence**.

# ### Winding Number as an Integral
# 
# The winding number can also be written as a compact formula using the unit vector $\mathbf{d}_d$, defined as
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{d}_d = \frac{\mathbf{d}}{|\mathbf{d}|}
# $$
# 
# The vector $\mathbf{d}_d(k)$ is well defined for all $k$ because $\mathbf{d}(k) \ne 0$.
# 
# You can check easily that the winding number $\nu$ is given by
# 
# $$
# \nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left( \mathbf{d}_d(k) \times \frac{d}{dk} \mathbf{d}_d(k) \right)_z \, dk 
# $$
# 
# To calculate $\nu$ directly from the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian, note that it is off-diagonal (in the basis of eigenstates of the chiral symmetry operator $\sigma_z$),
# 
# $$
# H(k) = \begin{pmatrix}
# 0 & h(k) \\
# h^*(k) & 0
# \end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{where } h(k) = d_x(k) - i d_y(k) 
# $$
# 
# The winding number of $\mathbf{d}(k)$ can be written as an integral using the complex logarithm function, $\log(|h| e^{i \arg h}) = \log |h| + i \arg h$. It is easy to check that
# 
# $$
# \nu = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} dk \, \frac{d}{dk} \log h(k)
# $$
# 
# Here, during the calculation of the integral, the branch cut for the logarithm is always shifted so that the derivative is well defined. The above integral is always real, since $|h(k = -\pi)| = |h(k = \pi)|$.

# ## Exact Calculation of Edge States
# 
# We now compute the zero-energy edge states of the SSH model in real space, without requiring translational invariance. Consider an SSH chain with $ N $ unit cells and complex intracell ($ t_1 $) and intercell ($ t_2 $) hopping amplitudes. The real-space Hamiltonian is:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( t_{1,n} |n_B\rangle \langle n_A| + \text{h.c.} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \left( t_{2,n} |(n+1)_A\rangle \langle n_B| + \text{h.c.} \right)
# $$
# 
# We look for a zero-energy eigenstate of the form:
# 
# $$
# \hat{H} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n |n_A\rangle + b_n |n_B\rangle \right) = 0
# $$
# 
# This yields the following set of equations:
# 
# For $ n = 1, \dots, N-1 $:
# 
# $$
# t_{1,n} a_n + t_{2,n} a_{n+1} = 0, \quad t_{2,n} b_n + t_{1,n+1} b_{n+1} = 0
# $$
# 
# At the boundaries:
# 
# $$
# t_{1,N} a_N = 0, \quad t_{1,1} b_1 = 0
# $$
# 
# The recursive solution to the bulk equations is:
# 
# $$
# a_n = a_1 \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} \left( -\frac{t_{1,j}}{t_{2,j}} \right), \quad b_n = b_N \cdot \left( -\frac{t_{1,N}}{t_{2,n}} \prod_{j=n+1}^{N-1} \frac{t_{1,j}}{t_{2,j}} \right)
# $$
# 
# The boundary conditions enforce $ b_1 = a_N = 0 $, which implies that in the generic finite case, there is no exact zero-energy eigenstate unless some hoppings vanish.
# 
# However, approximate edge-localized solutions exist in the thermodynamic limit $ N \to \infty $, provided that the average intercell hopping dominates the intracell hopping. Define:
# 
# $$
# \log |\bar{t}_1| = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \log |t_{1,n}|, \quad \log |\bar{t}_2| = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \log |t_{2,n}|
# $$
# 
# Then the amplitudes decay exponentially as:
# 
# $$
# |a_N| = |a_1| e^{-(N-1)/\xi}, \quad |b_1| = |b_N| e^{-(N-1)/\xi} \cdot \left| \frac{t_{1,N}}{t_{1,1}} \right|
# $$
# 
# with localization length:
# 
# $$
# \xi = \frac{1}{\log |\bar{t}_2| - \log |\bar{t}_1|}
# $$
# 
# This length scale determines how quickly the wavefunction decays away from the edge. It depends on the **difference** between the average strengths of inter-cell ($ t_{2,n} $) and intra-cell ($ t_{1,n} $) hoppings.
# 
# - If $ \log |t_{2,n}| > \log |t_{1,n}| $ (inter-cell hoppings dominate), then $ \xi > 0 $, and edge states can exist.
# - If $ \log |t_{2,n}| \leq \log |t_{1,n}| $ (intra-cell hoppings dominate or equal inter-cell hoppings), then $ \xi \leq 0 $, and no localized edge states form.
# 
# This shows that exponentially localized edge modes appear when $ |\bar{t}_2| > |\bar{t}_1| $, consistent with the topological phase of the SSH model.

# ### Hybridization of Edge States
# 
# The left and right edge-localized states can be written as:

# $$
# |L\rangle = \sum_{n=1}^N a_n |n_A\rangle, \quad |R\rangle = \sum_{n=1}^N b_n |n_B\rangle
# $$
# 
# with the coefficients \$a\_n\$ and \$b\_n\$ chosen according to the recursion relations, and normalized by setting \$a\_1\$ and \$b\_N\$ appropriately.
# 
# In a finite system, these two edge states are not completely decoupled; they hybridize under the full Hamiltonian \$\hat{H}\$, leading to a **small energy splitting**. This effect is exponentially suppressed in the system size \$N\$.
# 
# To a good approximation, the energy splitting can be estimated by computing the overlap:
# 
# $$
# \langle R | \hat{H} | L \rangle = \left| a_1 e^{-(N-1)/\xi} b_N \right| e^{i\phi}
# $$
# 
# with some arbitrary phase \$\phi \in $$0, 2\pi)\$. The hybridized eigenstates are:
# 
# $$
# |0^+\rangle = \frac{e^{-i\phi/2} |L\rangle + e^{i\phi/2} |R\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad E_+ = \left| a_1 e^{-(N-1)/\xi} b_N \right|
# $$
# 
# $$
# |0^-\rangle = \frac{e^{-i\phi/2} |L\rangle - e^{i\phi/2} |R\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad E_- = -\left| a_1 e^{-(N-1)/\xi} b_N \right|
# $$
# 
# Thus, the **energy splitting** between these two hybridized states is:
# 
# $$
# \Delta E = 2 \left| a_1 e^{-(N-1)/\xi} b_N \right|
# $$
# 
# This energy gap is **exponentially small** in \$N\$, and provides a signature of the **edge-state interaction**. In the topological phase with large \$N\$, this hybridization vanishes and the edge states become **nearly exact zero modes**.

# ## Bound States at Domain Walls
# 
# Edge states in the SSH model are not limited to the physical ends of an open chain; they can also appear at **domain walls** between topologically distinct insulating regions within the same chain.
# 
# This can be intuitively understood in the **fully dimerized limit**. Consider a system with alternating domains of different dimerization patterns. At the boundaries between these domains—called **domain walls**—new localized states can emerge.
# 
# There are two types of domain walls:
# 
# * A **single isolated site**, which hosts a **zero-energy state**:
# 
#   $$
#   \hat{H} \left( |6_B\rangle - |7_B\rangle \right) = 0
#   $$
# 
# * A **trimer**, where a zero-energy eigenstate is formed by an **odd superposition** of the two end sites.
# 
# Just like the edge states at the ends of the chain, these **domain-wall states** are **sublattice-polarized**—the wavefunction has support only on one sublattice.
# ![5](5.png) 
# 
# From a perfect dimerized configuration, **only an even number of domain walls can be introduced**. This means that if a domain wall localizes a state on one sublattice, there must be another domain wall somewhere else (possibly at the system edge) localizing a state on the opposite sublattice.
# 
# Now, consider a domain wall configuration **away from the fully dimerized limit**. The domain wall modes remain **exponentially localized**, but their wavefunctions now **penetrate slightly into the bulk**, forming **evanescent tails**. If two domain walls are separated by $M$ unit cells, their corresponding localized edge states **hybridize**, forming bonding and anti-bonding combinations. At **half-filling**, only the **lower-energy (bonding) state** is occupied.
# 
# This bonding state:
# 
# * Contains **one electron**,
# * Has a wavefunction **symmetrically localized** on both domain walls,
# * And therefore, **each domain wall carries half an electronic charge**.
# 
# This effect is a hallmark of **charge fractionalization**, and provides a striking consequence of the topological nature of the SSH model.
